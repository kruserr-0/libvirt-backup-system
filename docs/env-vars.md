# Configuration reference

The installed env file lives at
`/etc/libvirt-backup-system/libvirt-backup.env`. Values in the real process
environment override values in this file. Booleans accept (case-insensitive)
`1`, `true`, `yes`, `on` as true; `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` as false. Any
other value is rejected by preflight rather than silently coerced.

**Config changes flow through the shared NFS tree with an explicit
push/pull pair** — whenever you change a value here, roll it out like this
(see [`push-config` / `pull-config`](config-sync.md)):

```sh
# on the node you edited:
sudoedit /etc/libvirt-backup-system/libvirt-backup.env
sudo libvirt-backup-system start        # 1. apply locally
sudo libvirt-backup-system push-config  # 2. publish for the cluster

# on every other node:
sudo libvirt-backup-system pull-config  # 3. take over the shared config
sudo libvirt-backup-system start        # 4. apply locally
```

## Core

```
LIBVIRT_URI=qemu:///system
```

Libvirt connection used by `virsh` for VM discovery and state checks. This
Kopia engine only supports local libvirt transports (`qemu:///...` or
`qemu+unix://...`) because disk streaming runs local `qemu-nbd` against local
disk paths. Remote transports such as `qemu+ssh://`, `qemu+tcp://`, and
`qemu+tls://` are rejected by preflight.

```
BACKUP_PATH=
```

Root of the shared backup tree. Backups are written to:

```
BACKUP_PATH/<host-id>/kopia-repo/
```

Peer hosts' repos live at sibling `BACKUP_PATH/<other-host-id>/kopia-repo/`
paths. Only running VMs are backed up; offline VMs are logged as `skipping
vm because it is offline` and skipped.

```
HOST_ID=
```

Backup host folder name. Empty means "use this machine's `/etc/machine-id`".
Keep this stable: renaming `HOST_ID` writes new snapshots under a fresh repo
and leaves the old data untouched in the prior `HOST_ID` directory.

```
VM_BLACKLIST=
```

VM UUIDs to skip. Separate with spaces or commas. Use `virsh domuuid
<vm-name>` to look up a VM's UUID. The blacklist scopes to *taking* new
backups; restore and verify ignore it.

```
SYSTEMD_ON_CALENDAR=*-*-* 02:30:00
```

systemd `OnCalendar` value used when the backup timer is installed. Run
`start` after changing this so the backup timer is refreshed and reloaded.

```
BACKUP_REQUIRE_NFS_MOUNT=true
```

Require `BACKUP_PATH` to be a mounted filesystem, usually an NFS/QNAP mount.
**Enabled by default**: preflight fails when the mount is missing, and every
filesystem mutation during a run re-checks that the mount is still live (a
stale NFS handle counts as "not mounted"), so a dropped mount can never
silently send backups to the local disk. Set to `false` only for
intentionally local backup directories.

```
BACKUP_REQUIRE_FSTAB_CONSISTENCY=true
```

Require every node's `/etc/fstab` entry for the `BACKUP_PATH` mount to match
the entry recorded in the backup tree
(`BACKUP_PATH/libvirt-backup-mounts.json`): same upstream server (same
IP/export), same filesystem type, same mount options (order-insensitive).
The live mount is also compared against fstab so an edited-but-not-remounted
fstab is caught. Mismatches fail preflight before any backup is attempted,
and the error prints both fstab entries so you can copy the line from a
working joined node.

The first node records its fstab entry automatically (on `install` and on the
first successful `run`); joining nodes are validated against it. With a
single node the check only fires once that node's own fstab drifts from what
it recorded.

**If you change the NFS server address**: update `/etc/fstab` on ALL nodes,
remount, then run `push-config` on one node to re-record the shared entry.
Until then, preflight fails on every node whose fstab no longer matches the
recorded entry. Enabled by default; set to `false` to disable the check.

```
REQUIRE_ROOT=true
```

Require preflight and run commands to execute as root.

```
COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=86400
```

Timeout for external commands, including backup and restore streaming
pipelines (`qemu-nbd`, `nbdcopy`, `kopia snapshot create/restore`, and
`qemu-img convert`).

## Kopia repo

```
KOPIA_REPO_PATH=
```

Repo path override. Defaults to `BACKUP_PATH/<HOST_ID>/kopia-repo` when
empty. If set, it must still equal that discoverable per-host path; peer
listing and restore intentionally scan only `BACKUP_PATH/*/kopia-repo`.

```
KOPIA_PASSWORD_FILE=/etc/libvirt-backup-system/kopia.pw
```

Path to the shared-password file (mode 600, root-owned). Written by
`install` and rotated by `change-password`. Lose this file on every host
and the repos become unreadable.

```
KOPIA_CACHE_DIR=/var/cache/libvirt-backup-system/kopia
```

Local on-disk cache for Kopia chunk metadata. Speeds up subsequent
operations against the same repo. Can be deleted at any time; Kopia
rebuilds it on demand.

## Kopia tuning

```
KOPIA_PARALLELISM=4
```

Passed to `kopia snapshot create --parallel`. Higher values trade CPU and
read bandwidth for shorter per-VM backup windows; lower values reduce
contention with the running VMs.

```
KOPIA_SPLITTER=FIXED-4M
```

Chunker. Fixed-size is the correct splitter for opaque block streams
(raw disk images coming out of `nbdcopy`). Documented as advanced — change
only with a clean cutover; mixing splitters in one repo defeats dedup.

```
KOPIA_COMPRESSION=zstd-fastest
```

Repo-wide compression. Applied via the global Kopia policy on `start`.

## Retention

Mapped onto `kopia policy set --global --keep-*`. Defaults keep the latest 8
snapshots plus hourly points for 24h and daily points for one year:

```
KEEP_LATEST=8
KEEP_HOURLY=24
KEEP_DAILY=365
KEEP_WEEKLY=0
KEEP_MONTHLY=0
KEEP_ANNUAL=0
```

The Kopia maintenance timer (see below) prunes expired snapshots in the
background; the backup loop does not perform pruning itself.

## Maintenance and verify cadence

```
KOPIA_MAINTENANCE_INTERVAL=24h
```

Cadence for `kopia maintenance run` against the local repo. Daily quick
maintenance, weekly full maintenance. No global owner: each host maintains
its own repo.

```
KOPIA_VERIFY_INTERVAL=7d
```

Cadence for `libvirt-backup-system verify` against the local repo. Cross-host
verify is opt-in via `libvirt-backup-system verify --include-hosts=...` and is
not scheduled by default.

## Preflight estimate

```
SPACE_MARGIN_PERCENT=20
BACKUP_ESTIMATE_GB_PER_VM=1
```

Free-space margin and per-VM fallback estimate (in GB) used when disk
introspection fails. The estimate is the sum of virtual disk sizes for VMs
that do not already have Kopia meta snapshots, plus the configured margin.
VMs with prior Kopia snapshots add 0 because Kopia dedup absorbs unchanged
chunks.
