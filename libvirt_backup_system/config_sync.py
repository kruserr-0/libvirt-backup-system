"""Share the env config across hosts through the backup tree.

A single "shared config" file lives at ``BACKUP_PATH/<SHARED_CONFIG_NAME>``,
alongside the per-host ``BACKUP_PATH/<host-id>/kopia-repo/`` directories. It is
a *seed*, not a live-synced file:

* The first node publishes its config there (``install``/``start``, and the
  explicit ``update-config``).
* A node *joining* an existing backup tree pulls that seed as its initial
  local config, so it inherits retention, splitter, NFS policy, etc. without
  re-typing them.
* After joining, the local config is independent. Editing it does not touch
  the seed; the seed only changes when someone runs ``update-config``.

``HOST_ID`` is deliberately blanked in the seed: host identity scopes the
per-host repo (``BACKUP_PATH/<HOST_ID>/kopia-repo/``), so sharing it would
collide two hosts onto one repo. Each node falls back to ``/etc/machine-id``.
