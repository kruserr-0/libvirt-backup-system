"""End-to-end checks of the dynamic fish completion for ``restore``.

The completion functions in
libvirt_backup_system/data/libvirt-backup-system.fish are shell code, so we
exercise them by running fish itself with a stubbed ``libvirt-backup-system``
binary on PATH. The tests skip cleanly when fish is not installed so that CI
runners without fish do not fail the suite (the gate workflow installs fish
before running the gate).
